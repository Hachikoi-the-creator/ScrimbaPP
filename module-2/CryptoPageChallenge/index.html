          <p>If you've got lots of money and you're a bit daft, NFTs are a
            great way to pay for something that doesn't have any intrinsic
            value or even exist. Tech fashionistas are jumping on the NFT
            bandwagon and spending eye-watering sums of money on crypto images.
            Our advice: spend the weekend <a href="#">crafting an NFT</a> and by
            this time next week, you'll be a millionaire.</p>

          <p>Is $33k for sneakers too basic for you? No problem! This CryptoPunk
            (left) is a steal at $6.6 million! Which makes Bag #748 (right) a
            total bargain at $1.4 million. And by the way, that's not a VS
            Code screenshot we included by mistake. The eight lines of white text
            on a black background is the actual NFT we're selling.</p>

          <p>Still not convinced? To be honest, nor are we. That's why we're selling
            them, not buying them.</p>
